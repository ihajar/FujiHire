# Welcome to FujiHire Expo + React/Vite + Spring boot project ðŸ‘‹
## Frontend

1 - Context for user state and auth actions (login, signup, logout)
2 - Automatic user fetching on route change
3 - Route protection and redirects based on auth state and email verification
4 - Usage of a custom request helper for API calls
5 - Storage of JWT token in localStorage
6 - Usage of <Outlet /> for nested routes

## Expo app (with Tanstack Query)

1 - Use React Navigation instead of React Router for navigation/redirects.
2 - Use AsyncStorage or SecureStore instead of localStorage for tokens.
3 - Use TanStack Query for async API calls and caching.
